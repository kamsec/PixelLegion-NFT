### 3. Front-end
For this part we assume to be in `/PixelLegion-3-front-end/` folder.
- I decided to not make separate database since it is only 100 images. For larger projects you might want to make one.
- I was using `React` with `useDapp` and `MaterialUI`. For React and MaterialUI theres a lot of tutorials online, and for useDapp you can learn the basics at Lesson 13 of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ</a>
- The website is hosted on github-pages with the help of <a href="https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages">spa-github-pages</a>
- As it was my first project in React, you can probably look at front-end source code e.g. for references on how to work with useDapp, but other than that, relying only on it might not be the best idea :)
